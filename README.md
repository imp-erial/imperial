# Imperial

The main Imperial library code.

Currently laying the foundation. There's more code I've written but it isn't ready yet, so I'll slowly be putting that in.

Basic plan right now is to:

1. More unit tests for what's currently here
2. Port over static struct
3. Port over number struct (Packable, Serializable, Value, Number)
4. Make List and link mapper <- makes or breaks this implementation...
5. Complete Fileable, Bin, BinaryFile
6. Complete Stringifiable, String, TextFile
7. Finish Number, given completion of String
8. plan more

At some point should probably make an (ideally, graphical) overview of how everything fits together because it's necessarily absurd. That probably means UML, but we'll see.
